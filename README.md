# AI-Powered Lead Scoring Backend

A backend service built with **Node.js + TypeScript + Express** that automatically scores sales leads using a hybrid approach combining **rule-based logic** and **AI reasoning** to determine buying intent.

## üöÄ Features

### Core APIs

- `POST /api/offer` - Accept product/offer details
- `POST /api/leads/upload` - Upload CSV file with lead data
- `POST /api/leads/score` - Execute scoring pipeline on uploaded leads
- `GET /api/leads/results` - Retrieve scored results with intent classification
- `POST /api/leads/reset` - Reset current stored offer and leads data

### Scoring System

**Two-Layer Scoring (0-100 points total)**

**Rule Layer (Max 50 points):**

- Role relevance: Decision maker (+20), Influencer (+10), Others (+0)
- Industry match: Exact ICP (+20), Adjacent (+10), No match (+0)
- Data completeness: All fields present (+10)

**AI Layer (Max 50 points):**

- AI analyzes prospect + offer context
- Intent classification: High (50pts), Medium (30pts), Low (10pts)
- Provides 1-2 sentence reasoning

**Final Score = Rule Points + AI Points**

## üìù Important Note

This implementation does **not** use a database; offers and lead data are held in in-memory variables. As a result, the service supports only one active offer and one CSV upload at a time. This design choice was made to focus on core scoring logic and AI integration. For production use, consider adding persistent storage to handle multiple offers and concurrent uploads.

## üß† Scoring Logic Details

### Rule-Based Scoring (Max 50 points)

**Role Classification:**

- **Decision Makers (+20):** CEO, CTO, VP, Director, Head, Manager, Founder, President
- **Influencers (+10):** Senior, Lead, Principal, Specialist, Consultant, Advisor
- **Others (+0):** Developer, Engineer, Analyst, Intern, Assistant

**Industry Matching:**

- **Exact Match (+20):** Industry directly matches offer's ideal use cases
- **Adjacent (+10):** Related industries (e.g., SaaS ‚Üí Technology, FinTech ‚Üí Finance)
- **No Match (+0):** Unrelated industries

**Data Completeness (+10):**

- All required fields (name, role, company, industry, location, linkedin_bio) present

### AI Integration

**Prompt Template:**

```
You are an AI sales assistant. Evaluate the buying intent of this prospect based on the offer and their profile.

Offer:
Name: ${offer.name}
Value Props: ${offer.valueProps.join(", ")}
Ideal Use Cases: ${offer.idealUseCases.join(", ")}
Prospect:
Name: ${lead.name}
Role: ${lead.role}
Company: ${lead.company}
Industry: ${lead.industry}
Location: ${lead.location}
LinkedIn Bio: ${lead.linkedin_bio}
Task:
1. Classify intent as High / Medium / Low.
2. Give reasoning in 1‚Äì2 sentences based on how well the prospect fits the offer.
Output in JSON format:
{
  "intent": "High",
  "reasoning": "Reasoning text"
}.
```

**Intent Mapping:**

- **High Intent:** 50 points - Strong authority + perfect fit
- **Medium Intent:** 30 points - Some authority or good fit
- **Low Intent:** 10 points - Limited authority + poor fit

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing with Sample Data

2. Upload leads: `POST /api/leads/upload`
3. Run scoring: `POST /api/leads/score`
4. View results: `GET /api/leads/results`
5. Reset uploaded data: `POST /api/leads/reset`

## üìä Example Scoring Breakdown

**High-Score Lead (Score: 90)**

- Name: "Sarah Johnson, VP Marketing"
- Rule Points: 40 (Decision maker +20, Exact industry +20)
- AI Points: 50 (High intent - perfect authority and fit)
